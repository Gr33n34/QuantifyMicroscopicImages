# Quantify Microscopic Images
Sourcecodes of used applications for standardized quantification of images from histological specimens.

### App8_7.py – Watershed algorithm for nuclei segmentation
An algorithm to segment and count cells in microscopic images based on the watershed algorithm.

### App8_8.py – Parameters for cell classification
This can be used algorithm to explore measured parameters from other application (e.g. QuPath).

### App8_11.py – New classification algorithm
A new approach to find optimal thresholds from single-cell data with usage of previously known information.

### App8_13.py – Writing new channel and cluster IRA B cells
Code to create composite channels from multiple pictures for integration of more than 3 channels into RGB images.

### App8_14.py – Marginalzone expansion
A plain proof-of-concept algorithm to expand coordinates of irregular polygons, which can be used for object or ROI definition.

### App8_16.py – Cellular neighbourhood analysis
An algorithm to quantify the composition of nearest cells for each cell class by their coordinates.

### App8_17.py – Looping through positive pixel counts
An automatisation to assess the positive pixel count (PPC) for all images of a given project.

### App8_18.py – Imaging the microscopic landscape
An algorithm to create histological maps.
